# HDLBits_Solution
This repository displays my solution to the problem set on the website HDLBits.

💡 How to use:
- The problems solved will either be fundamental or the hardest of that part (no in-between).
- For some challenging problems, I will also attach the FSM diagram and explanation.
- For a few problems I will solve them using the concept of a UML state machine even if it can be solved by a normal state machine (just to practice :D)
